    "description-1": "<p>Erhan is proud to announce that the wait for his fifth theatre show will not be long. He and his longtime director, Han Coucke, have a fantastic idea, and together they decided to move ahead immediately. In doing so, they are closing a beautiful circle. What began with Komt goed, a performance about the Brussels attacks, will now be completed with their fifth evening show: Made in Cité. A piece they intend to link to 60 years of Turkish migration in Belgium.</p><p>He has often spoken about his Turkish heritage, but he has never truly offered a glimpse into the other side of his background: the mining region of Limburg — the cité. Today, he feels incredibly proud of it, and he wants everyone to know. With Made in Cité, he returns to his childhood as little Erhan and offers the audience a glimpse into the future as well.</p>",

He found the idea so brilliant that he thought: why not use him in a performance? With Made in Cité, he aims to innovate and take a different approach. His virtual great-grandchild will also have a role in the show. It will be a performance he hopes people will</p>",
