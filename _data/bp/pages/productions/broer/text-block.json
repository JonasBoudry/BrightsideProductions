    "rich-text": "<h2>A Tragicomic Story About Losing Someone Who Never Truly Left</h2><p>Lander has lost his brother. Well, not really… but also a little bit, or at least for a while. Or yes, not just for a while. Quite a long while, actually. Anyway: for quite a long while, Lander had sort of lost his brother. While Myrthe (from Grof Geschud) is off cuddling babies, Lander still has a story left to tell on his own. Well, “on his own”… let's say… Adriaan, the brother in question, is actually there too. Two theatre brothers who, after a turbulent period, finally share the stage again — brother to brother. In the tragicomic cabaret performance BROTHER, Lander wants to talk about everything that can bind and divide an older and a younger brother. About searching for direction when your role model disappears, and suddenly you have to go solo. Or well… not really solo, but still at least a little bit solo. </p><p><b>Text, performance & music</b>: Lander & Adriaan Severins (so… not the band “Lander & Adriaan”) </br><b>Coaching</b>: Myrthe van Velden, Janne Desmet </br><b>Dramaturgy</b>: Minou Bosua </br><b>Scenography</b>: Tim Clement </br><b>Light & sound</b>: Geert Custers </br><b>Photo</b>: Noortje Palmers</p>"
