    "description-1": "<p>The desert must be one of the least hospitable places a human being can live. However, our current way of food production is steadily pushing the soil towards desert. Has this always been the case or are there systems that work in the other direction? Time after time we come across the role of the tree and the combination of different vegetables, fruits and grains that make productive ecosystems more robust. Together we will visit the climax of nature on earth: the Amazon rainforest; only to discover that this was largely planted by mankind. So, if we did it once before, maybe... we can do it again?</p>",
    "description-2": "<p>As we look to the future, one of the greatest threats to life on Earth is the looming depletion of fertile soil. With the ever-increasing demands of human population growth and industrialization, our soils are being degraded at an alarming rate. But what would happen if we were to completely exhaust the world's supply of fertile soil? The consequences could be catastrophic. Without fertile soil, our crops would fail, leading to food shortages and famine on a scale we have never seen before. The loss of soil fertility could also trigger widespread environmental degradation, as ecosystems collapse and biodiversity plummets.</p>",
