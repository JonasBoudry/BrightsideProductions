    "rich-text": "<p>As we look to the future, one of the greatest threats to life on Earth is the looming depletion of fertile soil. With the ever-increasing demands of human population growth and industrialization, our soils are being degraded at an alarming rate. But what would happen if we were to completely exhaust the world's supply of fertile soil?The consequences could be catastrophic. Without fertile soil, our crops would fail, leading to food shortages and famine on a scale we have never seen before. The loss of soil fertility could also trigger widespread environmental degradation, as ecosystems collapse and biodiversity plummets.</p><p>Luckily huge problems come with huge opportunities. Not all is lost, for there is a solution that offers hope for our soil and for our future. Enter the food forest: a revolutionary approach to agriculture that mimics the diversity and resilience of natural ecosystems. Food forests are a type of agroforestry that combine fruit and nut trees, shrubs, and vegetables in a carefully designed, multi-layered system. By building food forests, we can restore degraded soils, sequester carbon and increase biodiversity, all while producing an abundance of nutritious food. These vibrant ecosystems also provide habitat for wildlife, purify the air and water and create valuable spaces for recreation and education.</p><p>With Eat More Trees, we will discover the incredible potential of food forests to save our soil and transform the way we produce food. We will meet the pioneers and visionaries who are leading the way and see firsthand how food forests can bring about a more just, sustainable and regenerative world.</p>"
